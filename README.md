# Candid-Commutators: Ludvig Sylows' Theorems On The Groups Of Substitutions
This study is a less condescending, candid review of Andrew Weils' proof of Fermats' Last Theorem, and to avoid guessing things which are obviously false.
We shall have a considerable degree of understanding on the techniques of congruent relations between modular forms. 
This will be achieved by finding the relevant properties of fitting ideals,
specifically on regular sequences(Also known as, an isomorphism of integer ring module as an R-module). 
We shall also explore in depth, but without complete rigor the concepts of modular elliptic curves and its association with Fermats' Last Theorem. 
A claim that it has the property of a radical solvable equation. This account does not provide a derivation of measurement and frequency,
but the pragmatic attitude taken is that it clarifies its Mathematical and Physical origin. Your confidence, or skepticism will depend on your temperament, 
and largely to your own interest.
